            Science52101 is a beginning group of experimental projects that aim for testing and studying technology, computers and general science with software and hardware tools.
            <br>
            It also looks for alternative ways of making software, algorithms and mathematical processes.

            <span class="psmall"><br>Algorithm and Data Structure eXperiments<br></span>
            There are many possible algorithms to be studied, made and applyed.
            <br>
            We look for pure and professional uses of programming concepts.

            Text may contain many patterns and standards to be observed and used.
            <br>
            Testing text manipulation and evaluation with linguistic concepts or syntax standards has always been an interest of this project.

            Other Science52101 technological experiments are coming.
            <br>
            Most of these are related to CPU and AI, by exploring Assembly and machine learning.

            <span class="ptitle">Mathematics</span><br>
            Science52101 is also building new projects related to Mathematics.
            <br>
            We are looking for any possibility of inovation, testing mathematical concepts.

            Since Akai Keisanki, the founder of Science52101 began designing interfaces for fun, this project also aims to develop a better user experience.
            <br>
            Future fixes and studies shall make the experiments and projects more elegant and robust.
